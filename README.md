# Geospatial Sciences (CEGE0094) 

Repository containing all of the work for the Geospatial Sciences course work

## Main Deadlines: 
- 9th December 21: Electronic poster submission (formative)
- 11th January 22: Final poster submission (assessed - 30% grade)

## Ideas:
- [Economic losses due to hydrological events around the world](https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.18t83t0)
  - Could do a map for drought and one for flooding in a specific region and then make a couple of scatter plots to see if that has changed over the years (with different countries in diff colors on the same scatter plot, so 2 plots and 2 choropleth maps) 

## Outcomes:
#### *Population affected by flooding in the South Asia Region between 1980 and 2014*
